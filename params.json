{"name":"Crabbattle","body":"<h2>Welcome to the Crab Battle</h2>\r\n\r\nThis codebase was initial submitted from Unity Forums. \r\n\r\nThis project was created to help people get a Client / Server Game going using <a href=\"http://unity3d.com\">Unity</a> and <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/lidgren-network-gen3/\">Lidgren</a>. Check back here or in <a href=\"http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/122560-Crab-Game-(Multiplayer-Client-Server-w-Lidgren-Source-Code)\">forums</a> for updates. \r\n\r\nLet the games begin,<br>\r\nTom Acunzo - aka <i>Tomoprime</i>\r\n\r\n_See at the bottom for notes and original source link from Doddler..._\r\n\r\n### Current version is 1.0.\r\n\r\n<b>Original Author:</b> Dan McNeill - aka <i>Doddler</i> Readme below...\r\n<hr>\r\n<pre>\r\nAbout Source Code\r\n\r\nI'm always learning about coding practices and such, you'll notice the code is pretty messy. \r\nIf you've seen I've done anything particularly erroneous, let me know! Everything that I made for the\r\ngame can be freely used for whatever, at your own risk etc. Stuff that isn't mine, well they have their\r\nown liscences that you'll have to meet the requirements of.\r\n\r\nThose components are as follows: \r\nScripts and assets in the 3rd party folder weren't created by me and are bound by their own liscences.\r\nThis includes Lidgren.Network, Detonator, and iTween.  The project also uses Vectrosity to generate the\r\nboundary circle. Since you actually have to buy vectrosity, it's not included in the project source. \r\nIf you have vectrosity, you'll have to drop it into the 3rdParty\\Vectrosity folder and uncomment the\r\nline \"#define Use_Vectrosity\" at the start of crabmanager.cs.\r\n\r\nThe music and sounds I took from other sources, I would recommend not using them yourself!  \r\nThe music is \"Aquaria Minibadass OC ReMix\" by Daniel Baranowsky, and the sound effects are ripped from\r\nthe Japanese PC mecha/novel game Baldr Force EXE by Giga.  \r\n\r\nThanks to both of them, hopefully they won't get mad at me for using them!\r\n\r\nOh!  And CryptoHelper.cs was written by a friend, so please don't use or distribute that either.\r\n\r\nI hope the code is helpful in someway and that you can learn something from it. :)\r\n\r\nDan \"Doddler\" McNeill (http://dodsrv.com/crabbattle/)\r\n</pre>","tagline":"A Semi Authoritative Multiplayer Game Example using Unity3D with Lidgren","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
