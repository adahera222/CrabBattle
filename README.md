About Source Code\
\
I'm always learning about coding practices and such, you'll notice the code is pretty messy.  If you've seen I've done anything particularly erroneous, let me know!\
\
Everything that I made for the game can be freely used for whatever, at your own risk etc.  Stuff that isn't mine, well they have their own liscences that you'll have to meet the requirements of.  Those components are as follows:\
\
Scripts and assets in the 3rd party folder weren't created by me and are bound by their own liscences.  This includes Lidgren.Network, Detonator, and iTween.  The project also uses Vectrosity to generate the boundary circle.  Since you actually have to buy vectrosity, it's not included in the project source.  If you have vectrosity, you'll have to drop it into the 3rdParty\\Vectrosity folder and uncomment the line "#define Use_Vectrosity" at the start of crabmanager.cs.\
\
The music and sounds I took from other sources, I would recommend not using them yourself!  The music is "Aquaria Minibadass OC ReMix" by Daniel Baranowsky, and the sound effects are ripped from the Japanese PC mecha/novel game Baldr Force EXE by Giga.  Thanks to both of them, hopefully they won't get mad at me for using them!\
\
Oh!  And CryptoHelper.cs was written by a friend, so please don't use or distribute that either.\
\
I hope the code is helpful in someway and that you can learn something from it. :)\
